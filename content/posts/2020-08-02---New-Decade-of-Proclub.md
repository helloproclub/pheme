Since it's inception in 2006, **Proclub Telkom University**, has gone through a lot of trials but also changes in the last decade. And though there are several hiccups along the way, Proclub managed to get some achievements and produce industry-grade talents throughout the decade. Proclub has gone a long way, and yet there is still much for us to do.

By the beginning of the decade, Proclub Telkom University will once again evolve to be a center of idea and innovation development on technology. This evolution may require changes in the organization structure, culture, and form. One of which being the leadership cycle will at the beginning of the academic calendar (around august) to match the Telkom University administration pace. Thus, a short leadership cycle is to be added until the new academic year comes. This short leadership will focus to continue what's being achieved in previous leadership, **Proclub AllOut**, and prepare the organization on what's to come. We believe that to achieve our goal that we need to better, that we need to go **beyond** AllOut. Therefore with new leadership, namely **Proclub Beyond**, and with your support, we hope to herald a brand new positive decade for the organization.

Sincerely,<br>
President of Proclub Telkom University<br>
