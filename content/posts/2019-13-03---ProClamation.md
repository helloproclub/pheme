Based on the Dean of School of Computing decision letter number
**39/KMH24/IF-DEK/2019**, starting from February 1st, 2019, Proclub became
an **independent student organization** under the School of Computing of
Telkom University. By the law, “Proclub” official name changed to
"Proclub Telkom University”. However, you may call us “Proclub” for short.
We are now an independent student organization that focuses on research,
career, and competition.

Proclub is transforming into a completely independent student organization.
We are now preparing some programs as part of our transformation. Soon, we
will also collaborate with several other laboratories to share our knowledge
through “ProTalk”. We intend to collaborate with some organizations in
Telkom University for a greater good. Are you guys curious about our next
actions? Do not worry, we are progressing for sure. Please wait a while until
it happens.

Sincerely,<br>
CEO of Proclub Telkom University<br>
Wisnu Adi Nurcahyo
